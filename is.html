				<h1 class="app-page_title state-nopreceedingimg">My name is Jack; I&rsquo;m a web designer</h1>
				<p>I've been making stuff for the web in some form or another for longer than I can remember (my first website was for my mum - isn't that a mantle every web designer has to step to at some point), and have been building sites full-time for the last 5 years or so.</p>
				<p>I cut my teeth as an in-house designer for Lewisham CLC, where I learnt (by trial and error) the fundamentals of building and maintaining live websites. The position allowed me to experiment with the best ways of building lean, beautiful CSS on top of semantic, accessable HTML.</p>
				<p>Next I worked for ThruSites (now ThruDigital), where I was tasked with producing finished web graphics which would be passed onto their developers to be built. It was a great experience, where I got the chance to work directly with their clients, building the designs.</p>
				<p>In early 2008 I started work at Cog Design, helping to build beautiful websites for clients mainly in the creative sector. With every project the best solution was found to suit the client's needs. All the sites were built with usability and accessability in mind, utilising the most current web standards applicable.</p>
				<p>On June 13th 2011, I started work at Tangent Snowball (in central London) as a front-end designer. Excitingly, we're currently working on creating our own open-source #webfont icon set, called Snowcone. Should be an interesting challenge!</p>
